# CarbonInjector

## Is this safe?
Yes, it is safe. If you don't believe it yourself check the source code. However before making assumptions this is a "Virus" because Windows defender says so it is only due to the fact of injection. Windows will flag this app as your INJECTING a file into an exe. Windows dont like this.
